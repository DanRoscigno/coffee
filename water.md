# Remineralizing water for coffee

## Hardness

Epsom Salts or Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate (MgSO4.7H2O)

Find the molecular weight

Google the answer: for example, searching “molecular weight of magnesium sulphate” 
gives me the answer: 120.366 g/mol.

You then need to add the molecular weight of the water in the crystal — 18 g/mol 
for each water molecule. So for our example with Epsom Salts: 

120.366 + (7 × 18) = 246.366 g/mol

To work out how much of a calcium or magnesium mineral you need to add to 1L of 
water to get a certain hardness, just divide that number by 100,000 then multiply by the number of ppm hardness you require.

So here’s how to get 100ppm of hardness, using our example of Epsom Salts: 

246.366 ÷ 100000 × 100 = 0.246g added to 1L water.


## Alkalinity

Potassium Bicarb

To work out how much of a bicarbonate you need to add to 1L of water to get a certain alkalinity,
just divide the number by 50,000 then multiply by the number of ppm alkalinity you require.

So, using Google we find that the molecular weight of potassium bicarbonate is 100.115 g/mol and it contains 
no extra water (anhydrous). To get 100ppm of alkalinity: 100.115 ÷ 50000 × 100 = 0.200g added to 1L water.

# Make a concentrate
I can't measure 200mg before I have had my coffee, so I will make a concentrate.  I would like ot be able to make 
20 gallons of coffee water without having to weigh the Epsom Salts and Bicarb every time.

1 gallon = 3.785 Liters (I am in the US)

Epsom Salts:
20 gallons x 3.785 liters / gallon x 0.246g / liter = 18.62 grams

Potassium Bicarb:
20 gallons x 3.785 liters / gallon x 0.200g / liter = 15.14 grams

# Another option: Prof. Pavlis' recipe

## Goal: 100mg / Liter Potassium Bicarb

## Concentrate:
Add 97g Potassium Bicarb to 1 gallon of RO water

## Coffee water:
Add 1 tablespoon of the concentrate to 1 gallon of water

## I want to keep the concentrate for 20 gallons handy, and I want it in a 1.5 liter bottle:

Prof. Pavlis's recipe makes a bunch more than 20 gallons from one gallon of concentrate:
```
1 gallon == 3.785 liters
1 tablespoon == 15ml
There are 3785 / 15 == 252 tablespoons in 1 gallon
```

20     xg
--  = ---
252   97g

20 x 97 = 252x

20 x 97
------- = x
 252

To make the concentrate, add 7.6g Potassium Bicarb to 1.5 L water

To make the coffee water add 75ml of concentrate to a 1 gallon bottle, and fill rest with RO water
