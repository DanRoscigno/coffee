# Profiles
Coffee, temperature, weight, pressure, time

## George Howell Tarrazu Espresso

 - straight to 6 bar and hold (cut it off at 35 g out)
 
 Stumptown Hair Bender
 - 93 °C

 Note: Based on [Pressure profiling, flow profiling, and a new rule of thirds](https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-machines/pressure-profiling-flow-profiling-and-new-rule-of-thirds-t29380.html) 
 at Home-Barista I will experiment with a finer grind and a 1 bar preinfusion
