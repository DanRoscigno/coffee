## LKM looks interesting
https://github.com/elkayem/CoffeeRoaster

Here is a closeup of the thermocouple placement used by LKM, the TC at the center measures the
environmental temp (the temp of the hot air) and the one toward the side of the chamber measures
the bean temp.

## Fireproof shopvac filter
[Filters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083W6564Q/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_UTFvEbEZHSGZH)

Need to think about whether or not the air is safe to recirculate after going through these filters

## Advice from "dja"
first thing to design is a handle on the roast chamber, mines pyrex and at 550 degrees its no fun if you forget you mitts

## Removing beans from roasting chamber
[Video from OldGearHead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDQoVGO9Ac4)

## Better way to remove the beans
No shopvac needed, use the pressure of the blower and seal off the exit with a rubber seal.  This forces the beans through a hose.

## Thermocouple placement

From OldGearHead

I ran my roaster for several months with a very long thermocouple from the top plate into
the bean mass,. and the temperatures were right on what the reference books say: 400-410°F 
first crack and 420-430°F finish. However, I also tracked everything with a second thermocouple 
located 1.5 inches below the perf plate. What I found was that after T+3 minutes the tc 
located below the perf plate tracked the BMT probe with an offset of -30°F. Therefore, 
two years ago, I stopped using the BMT probe and never looked back.

## Holder for pyrex
