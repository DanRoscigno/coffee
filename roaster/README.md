 - DC speed controller (KBIC-125, slightly higher current model than used by OGH). The blower never runs much over half speed, the DC controller is super.

## Fireproof shopvac filter
[Filters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083W6564Q/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_UTFvEbEZHSGZH)

Need to think about whether or not the air is safe to recirculate after going through these filters

## Advice from "dja"
first thing to design is a handle on the roast chamber, mines pyrex and at 550 degrees its no fun if you forget you mitts

## Thermocouple placement

From OldGearHead

I ran my roaster for several months with a very long thermocouple from the top plate into
the bean mass,. and the temperatures were right on what the reference books say: 400-410°F 
first crack and 420-430°F finish. However, I also tracked everything with a second thermocouple 
located 1.5 inches below the perf plate. What I found was that after T+3 minutes the tc 
located below the perf plate tracked the BMT probe with an offset of -30°F. Therefore, 
two years ago, I stopped using the BMT probe and never looked back.
